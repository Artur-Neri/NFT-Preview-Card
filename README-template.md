## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Transitions

### What I learned

In this project i had a chance to give my first shot at working with transitions. I spent some good 10 minutes trying to think of a way to make the hover effect on the top image. I got a little more familiar with the flexbox flex, inline and block properties so that is an achievement for me :).   


### Useful resources

- [W3schools transition docs](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) - This link gave me the first glance at transitions and I was able to do it on my own after reading through it.
